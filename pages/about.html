                <p class="fight-story"> <img src="visual/images/AlivInoki.jpg" alt=""><strong>Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)</strong>, sometimes referred to as cage fighting, no holds barred (NHB), and ultimate fighting, 
                    is a full-contact combat sport based on striking, grappling and ground fighting, incorporating techniques from various combat 
                    sports including boxing, kickboxing and martial arts from around the world. The first documented use of the term mixed martial 
                    arts was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993.
                    The question of who actually coined the term is subject to debate.

                    During the early 20th century, various interstylistic contests took place throughout Japan and in the countries of the Four Asian Tigers. 
                    In Brazil, there was the sport of Vale Tudo, in which fighters from various styles fought with little to no rules. The Gracie family was
                     known to promote Vale Tudo matches as a way to promote their own Brazilian jiu-jitsu style.[7] In the West, the concept of combining 
                     elements of multiple martial arts was popularized by Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do during the late 1960s to early 1970s. 
                    A precursor to modern MMA was the 1976 Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki exhibition bout (which ended in a draw after 15 rounds), 
                    fought between boxer Muhammad Ali and wrestler Antonio Inoki in Japan, where it later inspired the foundation of Pancrase in 1993 
                    and Pride Fighting Championships in 1997.

                    <img id="roycepic" src="visual/images/RoyceGracie.jpg" alt="">In 1980, CV Productions, Inc. created the first regulated MMA league in the United States, called Tough Guy Contest,
                    which was later renamed Battle of the Superfighters. The company sanctioned ten tournaments in Pennsylvania. However, in 1983 the 
                    Pennsylvania State Senate passed a bill prohibiting the sport.[8][9] In 1993, the Gracie family brought Brazilian jiu-jitsu, 
                    developed in Brazil from the 1920s, to the United States by founding the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) MMA promotion company in 
                    1993. The company held an event with almost no rules, mostly due to the influence of Art Davie and Rorion Gracie attempting to replicate 
                    Vale Tudo fights that existed in Brazil[7] and would later implement a different set of rules (example: eliminating kicking a grounded 
                    opponent), which differed from other leagues which were more in favour of realistic, street like fights.[10]

                    Originally promoted as a competition to find the most effective martial arts for real unarmed combat, competitors from different fighting styles 
                    were pitted against one another in contests with relatively few rules.[11] Later, individual fighters incorporated multiple martial arts
                     into their style. MMA promoters were pressured to adopt additional rules to increase competitors' safety, to comply with sport 
                     regulations and to broaden mainstream acceptance of the sport.[3] Following these changes, the sport has seen increased popularity with
                      a pay-per-view business that rivals boxing and professional wrestling.[12] ----- Wikipedia
